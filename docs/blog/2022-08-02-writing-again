<p>Hello ðŸ‘‹. After a long hiatus and letting my public writing and this personal site lapse, I&rsquo;ve decided to resume my efforts here. I realized a while ago that with these blogs, absent a large pre-existing social media presence, we&rsquo;re really writing for ourselves first and foremost. If someone happens to benefit from our writing, that is wonderful but a non-goal at this stage. I hope to use this space to continue to use this space to organize my thoughts as well as share things I like, find thought provoking, or beautiful.</p>
