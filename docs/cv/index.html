    <h2>Consulting Engineer</h2>
    <h3>2013 - 2018 (Select Experiences included)</h3>

    <strong>Draft</strong>
    <p>
      Following their acquisition by Paddy Power Betfair (Flutter Entertainment), 
      Draft.com began a major marketing spend ahead of the 2017 NFL Season. I was
      brought on as a consultant to scale the backend ahead of the season.
      I identified scaling bottlenecks in the app code, architecture, and underlying 
      libraries. I provided remedies and guidance to address each. Additionally I 
      constructed a massively concurrent realtime websocket/http load testing script 
      to prove out scalability and find networking/IO bottlenecks along the way. Draft is now part of FanDuel.
    </p>

    <strong><a href="https://greenbusinesspartnership.org" target="_blank">Green Business Partnership</a></strong>
    <p>
      Green Business Partnership evolved out of a Westchester County effort to
      help businesses adopt sustainable practices. I developed a comprehensive web
      application to allow them to manage their member subscriptions and sponsorships.
      Additionally, a React interface guides companies and their employees through
      a survey to collect the specifics of their practices such as energy usage and
      waste production to aid in their certification effort.
    </p>

    <strong><a href="http://medlypharmacy.com/" target="_blank">Medly Pharmacy</a></strong>
    <p>
      Medley Pharmacy delivers prescriptions to your door for free. They have over a dozen
      brick and mortar locations in NYC and are launching an iOS app. This work was in
      collaboration with <a href="https://blog.goposse.com/" target="_blank">Posse</a>.
      I worked heavily on the backend and administrative interfaces while interacting with the
      client to get closer to launch.
    </p>

    <strong><a href="https://getswill.com" target="_blank">Swill</a></strong>
    <p>
      I built an inventory pipeline which accepts, extracts, transforms, and normalizes
      data from thousands of point-of-sale systems into a single stream of product
      inventory representing all of Swill's partner stores. This involved a complex
      information retrieval and extraction hierarchy and we leverage a machine trained
      model for new product discovery as well as a whole host of tricks and heuristics
      to get high accuracy real time data as output.
    </p>

    <strong>EnhancedMood</strong>
    <p>
      I worked directly with a clinician to develop a simple iOS app (ReactNative)
      to allow users to inventory their current mood. The simple routine of
      "checking in" to an emotion and receiving a content-based reward is proving
      to break the cycle of negative thoughts and emotions. The program is now
      entering an NYU accelerator.
    </p>

    <strong>Vive Style</strong>
    <p>
      As a contractor I led, for several months, development at Vive.co in the absence
      of an in-house team and only a small set of remote contractors. I worked with
      the CEO to organize the development roadmap and coordinated with designers to
      build an agency-style process within a fast moving start up. We produced comprehensive
      designs which reflected the true long term business priorities and worked to
      incrementally implement them across multiple platforms.
    </p>

    <strong><a href="http://parachutehealth.com" target="_blank">Parachute Health</a></strong>
    <p>
      I worked with Parachute Health to create a microservice backend and API to
      securely and compliantly verify the eligiblity of incoming patient insurance
      data for an array of medical products. This involved very strict validation,
      composable rules, and in the case of failure, detailed responses and steps to correct.
    </p>

    <strong><a href="https://bibme.org" target="_blank">BibMe.org</a></strong>
    <p>
      BibMe is an extremely high-traffic citation service for students and researchers.
      I implemented a redesign to help boost ad-traffic and usability of the site.
      I also increased the number of sources from which users could cite from 4 to 7000+ and
      implemented a complementary cross-platform interactive search tool for discovery of such sources.

    <h3>
      Union Square July 2011 - April 2012 (NYC TechStars 2011)
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was the first product &amp; engineering hire at Urtak. Urtak built a highly innovative
      collaborative polling technology with extraordinarily high engagement rates
      with audiences. Placed below an article and kicked-off by a publications'
      staff the poll quickly gets richer as users contribute yes/no questions to it.
    </p>
    <img width="100%" caption="Our designer, Sascha Mombartz, put this together" src="https://www.kunalashah.com/images/urtak-future-313a7399.png" />
    <p>
      We never quite figured out how to turn it into an ad product but it was
      quite a journey nonetheless. I mostly worked as an engineer on the core of the product
      and pursued building out our statistics and visualizations capabilities to better
      understand and share our data.

    <img width="100%" caption="This was an early draft of my analytics dashboard, this poll in particular broke the scales! Had to make them dynamic after that." src="https://www.kunalashah.com/images/urtak-analytics-3a0fa16d.png" />

    <h1>Projects &amp; Experiments</h1>

    <h2>Salt to Taste</h2>
    <p>
      My 'unicorn' project, to-be-rebooted. Salt to taste is a collaborative cookbook
      where users with different taste preferences and dietary restrictions can edit
      in-line other peoples recipes, creating a 'fork' a-la-git(hub). Edits can be
      upvoted and popular changes will automatically become the default ('master') version
      of a recipe.
    </p>

    <h2>Up On The Board</h2>
    <p>
      Up On The Board was an experiment when I was first learning React. The idea is
      to create a public self-cleaning pinboard. Old posts slowly dissapear unless they are
      still relevant (upvoted). Posts can be tweeted, emailed, SMS'ed, or posted over
      the web with text or rich media. The pinboard's content flows responsively and will
      only show the number of posts which can tastefully fit on the viewing device.
      Each board comes with a Chromecast (now 'Google Cast') integration so that offices
      can use it as an internal memorandum board on any TV they may have mounted.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/kshahkshah/humblesuggestions" target="_blank">Humble Suggestions</a></h2>
    <h3>February - June 2013</h3>
    <p>
      Humble Suggestions was an experiment which arose out of services like pinboard,
      Instapaper and more recently Pocket which push content onto a queue for you to
      consume later. Humble Suggestions would resurface content at contextually appropriate times.
      I discovered the same thing Netflix did, which is that on Friday at 7PM, before going out
      you may not want to watch an old black and white movie on your Netflix queue,
      but a rainy Sunday afternoon might just be the perfect time to send you a reminder as a
      humble suggestion. I shut down the service after Netflix discontinued their API.
