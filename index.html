        Hi, I'm Kunal. I live in Clinton Hill, a kind Brooklyn neighbourhood by way of New Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like building things and helping people. When I was little I built drag cars, robots and 
        spaceships out of k'nex. I took everything with a plug apart to see how it worked, 
        usually didn't figure it out, electrocuted myself a few times, and broke a lot of electronics. 
        My brother then got me hooked on strategy games (much safer) and since my house was online early on, 
        I created a website around them. It was powered by ColdFusion, IIS, Apache and MSSQL. 
        Thankfully, the last time I (and probably anyone else) would use such a combination.
      </p>

        Before I went to college, I became an EMT. Newark is a tough town and being there is a quick 
        education for anyone who grew up in the suburbs. The food, the people, and my fellow techs were 
        amazing. My time as an EMT made me think about medicine a lot. So in college, I took a break from 
        computing to learn something that had always alluded me: chemistry. In the end though, it was learning 
        biology which elucidated the true relationships between molecules. You come to realize that all 
        molecules are breathing, they expand, they contract. Their atoms long to be in stable relationships 
        with their neighboring atoms and given the chance (i.e activation energy) they'll reform to accomplish 
        just that. Biology is an application of chemistry restricted to certain media.
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined a protein engineering laboratory and my focus again shifted from medicine to research. 
        I designed and built (that's 'expressed' to you few on the inside) proteins for use in artificial 
        tissues and drug delivery. It was really interesting work, but I was continuously frustrated that 
        science could be so tedious and the tools we used, in my estimation as a coder, were so out of date. 
        I knew then I wanted to help researcher scientists solve their problems by giving them access to better 
        software. But I wasn't ready yet. I left school confused.. but I still knew code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked at a creative agency (read: web shop) writing content management systems, and then joined a 
        few startups. Along the way, I've discovered that I really like systems engineering, which to me means 
        I like it when people work together seamlessly to make beautiful things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've now returned to my goal of helping research scientists and I've created 
        <a href="http://experimentools.com" target="_blank">experimentools.com</a> in November 2010 to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to being long winded and a poor writer I'm an avid music fan, a gardener, a cyclist, 
        and new to snowboarding. Every once in a while I've been known to read a book. I really like history, 
        trivia, computing and biology. This is my website.
