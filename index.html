        Hi, I'm Kunal. I live in Clinton Hill, a kind Brooklyn neighbourhood by way of New Jersey.

      <p>
        I like building things. When I was young, I built some drag cars and spaceships out of k'nex. 
        My brother got me hooked on strategy games and we were online pretty early so I created a 
        website around them. It was powered by ColdFusion, IIS, Apache and MSSQL. Thankfully, the 
        last time I (and probably anyone else) would use such a combination.
      </p>

        Before I went to college, I became and EMT. Newark can be a bad town, but the food and people 
        are amazing. At college, I took a break from computing to try and learn something I was pretty 
        bad at : chemistry. Learning biology, though, made the relationships between molecules a lot easier 
        for me to grasp. You come to realize the static models of atoms they teach you in grade school 
        don't really paint an accurate picture. All molecules are breathing, they expand and contract. 
        They all desire to be stable and given the chance, or activation energy, they'll do just that.
      </p>

        Armed with that knowledge I joined a protein engineering laboratory and my focus shifted from 
        medicine to research. I designed and built (that's 'expressed' to you on the inside) proteins 
        for use artificial tissues and drug delivery. It was really interesting work, but I was continuously 
        frustrated that science can be so tedious and the tools we used were just not up to par in my view 
        as a coder. I knew then I wanted to help researcher scientists solve their problems by giving them 
        access to better software. But I wasn't ready yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked at a creative agency (read: web shop) writing content management systems, and joined a 
        few startups. Along the way, I discovered that I really like systems engineering. I like making 
        things run very smoothly. It fits well with a common thread through out all this: building things 
        and helping people. I've now returned to my goal of helping research scientists and I've created 
        <a href="http://experimentools.com" target="_blank">experimentools.com</a> in November 2010 to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an avid music fan, a gardener, a cyclist, and new to snowboarding. Every once in a while I've 
        been known to read a book. I really like history, trivia, computing and biology. This is my 
        website.
