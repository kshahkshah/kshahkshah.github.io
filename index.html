        Hi, I'm Kunal. I live in Clinton Hill, a kind Brooklyn neighbourhood by way of New Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like building things. When I was young, I played with k'nex and built some pretty sweet 
        drag cars and spaceships. I got online pretty early and built a pretty neat gaming website 
        in ColdFusion (throwback, right?!). It was powered with IIS, Apache and MSSQL. Thankfully, the 
        last time I (and probably anyone else) would use such a combination.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a break from computing to study chemistry and biology. I designed and built 
        proteins (seriously!) for usage in engineering artificial tissue and drug delivery. It 
        was really interesting, but lab work is slow moving and tedious. I returned to code 
        because I wanted to make the massive data problems that scientists encounter easier to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, I discovered that I really like systems - especially ones which I can make run 
        smoothly. So I've been getting better at taking a step back, analyzing, understanding, taking a 
        long view and then coordinating, facilitating, and helping people. That's where I'm at. I love 
        bringing people together around a common goal and executing it well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an avid music fan, a gardener, a cyclist, and new to snowboarding. Every once in a while I've 
        been known to read a book. I really like history, trivia, computing and biology. This is my 
        website.
