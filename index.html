      <p>
        I'm Kunal, I live in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.
      </p>

        I like building things and helping people. When I was young(er) I built drag cars, robots and 
        spaceships (out of k'nex). I played outside in streams, climbed things, biked around, took apart 
        electronics, electrocuted myself, and made websites. Anyone remember Kai's Powertools, IIS, 
        or ColdFusion? (don't hate CF, it was way ahead of its time and proprietary)
      </p>

        Just before I left for college, I became an EMT. Let's just say Newark lives up to it's reputation. Naturally, 
        I thought about biology a lot. So in college, I studied molecular biology instead of computer science.
        Biology is an application of chemistry restricted to certain media (solutions). Computer science, similarly, 
        is an application of mathematics restricted to certain media (pcbs). How's that for a wisdom bomb?

        Turns out that research science isn't very profitable, and I still like coding a lot. There are so 
        many parallels between computing and biology that I'm truly glad I didn't formally study computer science. 
        In any case it was a good choice, my career goal involves moving up the stack, not further down it. 
      </p>

        In addition to being long winded and poor writer I'm an avid music fan, a gardener, a cyclist, a climber, 
        a hiker, a traveler, and recently a snowboarder. I really like history, trivia, computing and biology. 
        This is my website.
