<p>ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors are commonly prescribed for diabetics who have developed complications with their kidneys. When faced with chronic elevated blood-sugar levels your kidneys, which are responsible for filtering blood, begin to work overtime and then eventually fail. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and thereby decrease input volume across the kidneys reducing their net load.</p>
