<p>Ennio Morricone&#8217;s brilliance is unparalleled. Another video I&#8217;ve met to put up for a while which I was certain I must have previously posted but apparently have not.</p>

<p>I must of course note that Once Upon a Time In the West is a true classic and retains every bit of its luster. A must watch.</p><div class="attribution">(<span>Source:</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">https://www.youtube.com/</a>)</div>
