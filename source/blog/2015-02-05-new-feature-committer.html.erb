Another piece of the puzzle: auto-commit incoming blog posts.<div><br></div>
<div>Now when you useÂ https://github.com/whistlerbrk/Mail2FrontMatter any incoming emails to your blog will not only be parsed, processed and written, but also now committed to git and push.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>With this final piece the dual workflow is complete. On the road or when time is short: email your blog. For lengthier articles break out your editor and plunk it down.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>A little more polish on the configuration options -- namely, making this optional and I'll push a new version of the gem.</div>
