They need to stand up and really represent us. I don't know if involves lobbying or advocacy but probably both.</p>

Lawyers who use their knowledge to unethically tie down our system should be ruthlessly debarred. Professional engineering societies should continuously demand better and better standards. There is no shortage of people who want to go into these careers and having bad actors spoils everyones view of the whole. Just look at the crisis of science and peer review.</span></p>
