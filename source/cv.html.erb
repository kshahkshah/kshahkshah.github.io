    <h1>Technology Consultant</h1>
    <h2>2013 - Present</h2>
    <p style='line-height:1.5em; font-size:17px; font-weight:100;'>
      I consult for select clients offering full stack development using a wide array
      of backend, frontend, data processing and data warehousing technologies. My scope of
      responsibilities generally include architecting and building whole projects or leading
      a specific feature from concept to deployment. Additionally I offer UI/UX consulting
      principally working with designers to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience
      in line with the needs of the business while handily clarifying scope for engineering.

    <h4 style='color:#FFF;'><a href="https://getswill.com" target="_blank">Swill</a></h4>
    <p>
      A work in progress. I'm building a massively parallel real time system for the digestion
      of inventory data sourced from thousands of unique point-of-sale systems across the country.
      Incoming data is stored, parsed, and interpreted using both a machine learned model and
      heuristic approaches to extract product and inventory data which is then matched against
      a canonical internal product database. The system allows us to determine inventory across
      thousands of partner stores in near real time.

    <h4 style='color:#FFF;'><a href="https://vive.co" target="_blank">Vive Style</a> (YCombinator '15)</h4>
    <p>
      As a contractor I led for several months development at Vive.co in the absence
      of an in-house team and only a small set of remote contractors. I worked with
      the CEO to organize the development roadmap and coordinated with designers to
      build an agency-style process within a fast moving start up. We produced comprehensive
      designs which reflected the true long term business priorities and worked to
      incrementally implement them across multiple platforms.

    <h4 style='color:#FFF;'>Four Winds Katonah</h4>
    <p>
      I built a backend for an application serving in-patients at mental health
      facilities to self assess their feelings. The goal was to decrease incidents
      with clinical staff and self-harm by providing an outlet for patients to freely
      express their emotions. Patients can "check-in" to an emotion and are rewarded
      with a variety of content supplied via the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked directly with a clinician who'd found that a simple routine of
      acknowledgment of negative emotion paired with a positive stimuli
      drastically reduced drug interventions and incidents with clinical staff.
      The backend is HIPPA compliant and allows clinicians to track overall
      progress at a facility or an individual patient.

    <h4 style='color:#FFF;'><a href="https://parachutehealth.com" target="_blank">Parachute Health</a></h4>
    <p>
      I worked with Parachute Health to create a microservice backend and API to
      securely and compliantly verify the eligiblity of incoming patient insurance
      data for an array of medical products. This involved very strict validation,
      composable rules, and in the case of failure, detailed responses and steps to correct.
    </p>
    <h4 style='color:#FFF;'><a href="https://bibme.org" target="_blank">bibme.org</a> (acquired by chegg)</h4>
    <p>
      BibMe is an extremely high-traffic citation service for students and researchers.
      I implemented a redesign to help boost ad-traffic and usability of the site.
      I also increased the number of sources from which users could cite from 4 to 7000+ and
      implemented a complementary cross-platform interactive search tool for discovery of such sources.

    </h3>
    <p>
      I was the first engineering hire at Urtak. Urtak built a highly innovative
      collaborative polling technology with extraordinarily high engagement rates
      with audiences. Placed below an article and kicked-off by a publications'
      staff the poll quickly gets richer as users contribute yes/no questions to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      We never quite figured out how to turn it into an ad product but it was
      quite a journey nonetheless. I did core engineering and pursued building
      out our statistics and visualizations to better understand and share our data.
